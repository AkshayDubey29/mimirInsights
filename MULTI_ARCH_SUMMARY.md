# Multi-Architecture Container Setup Summary

## Overview

MimirInsights now supports multi-architecture containers that can run on different CPU architectures:
- **AMD64 (x86_64)**: Traditional Intel/AMD servers and desktops
- **ARM64 (aarch64)**: Apple Silicon Macs, ARM-based servers (AWS Graviton, etc.)
- **ARM v7**: 32-bit ARM devices (Raspberry Pi 3, etc.)

## Quick Start

### 1. Test Multi-Architecture Support
```bash
./test-multi-arch.sh
```

### 2. Build Multi-Architecture Images (Local)
```bash
./build-multi-arch-local.sh
```

### 3. Build Multi-Architecture Images (Production)
```bash
./build-multi-arch.sh
```

### 4. Deploy Multi-Architecture Images
```bash
./deploy-multi-arch.sh
```

## Makefile Integration

New Makefile targets have been added:

```bash
# Build multi-architecture images
make multi-arch-build

# Build for local testing
make multi-arch-build-local

# Test multi-architecture support
make multi-arch-test

# Deploy multi-architecture images
make multi-arch-deploy
```

## Key Features

### Backend (Go Application)
- **Cross-compilation**: Uses Go's built-in cross-compilation
- **Platform detection**: Runtime architecture detection
- **Optimized binaries**: Stripped and optimized for each platform
- **Security**: Non-root user execution

### Frontend (React + Nginx)
- **Pre-built application**: React app built once, deployed everywhere
- **Runtime configuration**: Architecture-specific configuration injection
- **Nginx optimization**: Optimized for each platform
- **Health checks**: Platform-agnostic health monitoring

## Architecture Support Matrix

| Architecture | Backend | Frontend | Use Case |
|--------------|---------|----------|----------|
| linux/amd64  | ✅      | ✅       | Traditional servers, x86_64 desktops |
| linux/arm64  | ✅      | ✅       | Apple Silicon, ARM servers |
| linux/arm/v7 | ✅      | ✅       | Raspberry Pi 3, ARM devices |

## Benefits

### 1. **Universal Compatibility**
- Run on any supported architecture without modification
- Automatic platform selection by Docker
- No emulation overhead

### 2. **Performance**
- Native performance on target architecture
- Optimized binaries for each platform
- Reduced resource usage

### 3. **Deployment Flexibility**
- Deploy to mixed-architecture clusters
- Support for edge computing devices
- Cloud provider flexibility

### 4. **Development Experience**
- Test on local architecture
- Consistent behavior across platforms
- Simplified CI/CD pipelines

## Usage Examples

### Local Development (Apple Silicon)
```bash
# Build for local testing
./build-multi-arch-local.sh

# Run locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/akshaydubey29/mimir-insights-backend:local-20241217-143022
docker run -p 8081:80 ghcr.io/akshaydubey29/mimir-insights-frontend:local-20241217-143022
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build and push production images
./build-multi-arch.sh

# Deploy to Kubernetes
./deploy-multi-arch.sh
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
```yaml
# values.yaml
frontend:
  image: ghcr.io/akshaydubey29/mimir-insights-frontend:v1.0.0-20241217-143022
  imagePullPolicy: Always

backend:
  image: ghcr.io/akshaydubey29/mimir-insights-backend:v1.0.0-20241217-143022
  imagePullPolicy: Always
```

## Verification

### Check Image Manifests
```bash
# Verify multi-architecture support
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/akshaydubey29/mimir-insights-backend:latest
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/akshaydubey29/mimir-insights-frontend:latest
```

### Test on Different Architectures
```bash
# Test AMD64
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 ghcr.io/akshaydubey29/mimir-insights-backend:latest uname -m

# Test ARM64
docker run --rm --platform linux/arm64 ghcr.io/akshaydubey29/mimir-insights-backend:latest uname -m
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker Buildx not available**
   ```bash
   # Install Docker Desktop or enable buildx
   docker buildx install
   ```

2. **Memory issues during build**
   ```bash
   # Increase Docker memory allocation to 8GB+
   # Use build-multi-arch-local.sh for faster builds
   ```

3. **Platform-specific failures**
   ```bash
   # Check platform support
   docker buildx ls
   
   # Use specific platforms
   --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64
   ```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check builder status
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap

# List available builders
docker buildx ls

# Check image details
docker buildx imagetools inspect <image>

# Test specific platform
docker run --rm --platform linux/arm64 <image> uname -m
```

## Performance Metrics

### Build Times
- **Production build**: ~10-15 minutes (all architectures)
- **Local build**: ~5-8 minutes (AMD64 + ARM64 only)

### Image Sizes
- **Backend**: ~15-20MB per architecture
- **Frontend**: ~50-60MB per architecture
- **Total**: ~200-300MB for all architectures

### Runtime Performance
- Native performance on target architecture
- No emulation overhead
- Optimized binaries for each platform

## Next Steps

1. **Test the setup**: Run `./test-multi-arch.sh`
2. **Build locally**: Run `./build-multi-arch-local.sh`
3. **Deploy**: Run `./deploy-multi-arch.sh`
4. **Monitor**: Check architecture detection in logs
5. **Optimize**: Fine-tune for your specific use case

## Support

For issues with multi-architecture builds:
1. Check Docker Buildx setup
2. Verify platform support
3. Review build logs
4. Test on target architecture
5. Check the comprehensive documentation in `docs/MULTI_ARCH_SETUP.md`
